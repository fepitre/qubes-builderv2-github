If you're release manager, you can issue GPG-inline signed command:

* `Upload-component r4.2 {package_name} a6ff3071aa650f6ae9639c07e133eb27cffd91df current all` (available 5 days from now)
* `Upload-component r4.2 {package_name} a6ff3071aa650f6ae9639c07e133eb27cffd91df security-testing all`

You can choose subset of distributions like:
* `Upload-component r4.2 {package_name} a6ff3071aa650f6ae9639c07e133eb27cffd91df current vm-bookworm,vm-fc37` (available 5 days from now)

Above commands will work only if packages in current-testing repository were built from given commit (i.e. no new version superseded it).
